# Braintest Load Test Suite

A load testing suite for running benchmarks on self-hosted Braintrust data planes.

## Overview

This suite currently supports three types of tests:

- **Load Test**: Spawns simulated users to bombard the data plane with logs, simulating production traffic

- **Large Eval Test**: Generates a large synthetic dataset and runs an eval against it

- **Functional Test**: Exercises core API create/read/delete flows across key Braintrust resources

The suite can be extended to support additional test types in the future, and that is a goal.

Each test is highly configurable via the `braintest.yaml` config file. The tests should be configured to simulate a customer's expected load and usage patterns. We want to ensure that the infra Braintrust is hosted on can handle the customer's use case, and size up components accordingly if the tests fail.

## Getting Started

1. Install uv if you don't have it:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
3. Activate the virutal env uv creates if it isn't already activated
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file (see `example.env` for reference)

5. Configure `braintest.yaml` with your environment details and test parameters.

6. Execute the test suite:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

7. If you are running over SSH on a remote server, use `nohup` so the test keeps running if your session disconnects:
   ```bash
   nohup python main.py &
   ```
   This will write output to a default log file. To write `nohup` output to a specific file:
   ```bash
   nohup python main.py > loadtest.out 2>&1 &
   ```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY` | Yes | API key for authenticating with the Braintrust API. |
| `BRAINTRUST_API_URL` | No | Overrides `braintrust.api_url` from `braintest.yaml`. Use this to point directly at a data plane URL. When set, all test requests go to this URL instead of the default control plane, avoiding 421 `DataPlaneRedirectError` responses. |

Set these in a `.env` file (see `example.env`) or export them in your shell.

## Important Notes
- No actual LLM calls are made in any of these tests. Everything is mocked. The purpose is to load test Braintrust infra, not the LLM provider.
